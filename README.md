# Maximum a Posteriori Classification

Maximum a Posteriori or MAP for short is a Bayesian-based approach to estimating a distribution and model parameters that best explain an observed dataset. MAP is appropriate for those problems where there is some prior information, e.g. where a meaningful prior can be set to weigh the choice of different distributions and parameters or model parameters. MLE is more appropriate where there is no such prior.
